EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
While in the program's current directory, type

make

to compile. Then type

./a.out fileone filetwo

to execute the program. 

For some reason when running this program on my computer I get 0.000000 ms for step 1 and 2. 
I feel like this is the case only when running on my machine.
